        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            This tutorial will walk the reader through the basics of creating a SMART on FHIR application and deploying
            that application to various FHIR sandbox environments, covering Cerner, Epic, and SMART.
        </p>

        <p>
            This tutorial is inspired by the Cerner SMART on FHIR tutorial, taking cues from their work in terms of
            project
            structure and overall approach to demonstrating SMART on FHIR while attempting to create an updated, vendor
            agnostic look at SMART on FHIR applications. Key differences between this tutorial and the Cerner version
            include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Utilizing the 2.3.10 version of the SMART JavaScript Client library, which features a major change from
                the 1.x version included in the Cerner tutorial. For more information, see the following section
                regarding Fhir.js.
            </li>
            <li>
                Provides FHIR R4 examples in addition to dstu2, as well as version detection using the client.
            </li>
            <li>
                Simplified JavaScript which may be more easily understood by developers inexperienced with JavaScript or
                jQuery. (Note: Because of this, code should not be considered indicative of JavaScript best
                practices.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Provides instructions for testing with Epic's sandbox using LaunchPad.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h3>SMART JS Client 1.x vs 2.x - Fhir.js</h3>
        <p>
            Early versions of the SMART JS client included integration with the Fhir.js library, which is reflected in
            the
            Cerner tutorial example code. The primary loss here is the use of some API calls, which must reproduced
            using
            the SMART JS Client request function.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the Cerner code includes the line "smart.patient.api.fetchAll({type: 'Observation',...})"
            utilizing the Fhir.js API element.
            To do similar using the SMART JS client, you could simply
        </p>
        <p>
            For more on this issue, you can read the SMART JS documentation <a
                href="http://docs.smarthealthit.org/client-js/#fhirjs-integration">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Prerequisites and Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You should have at least a basic understanding of working with FHIR Resources and Bundles, though the
                code was written in an attempt to be accessible to FHIR novices.
            </li>
            <li>
                In order to deploy to GitHub Pages for some demonstrations, you are required to have a
                <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account.
                (Setting up any other accounts required will be discussed as part of the tutorial itself.)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                For local testing, it is also recommended that you have an IDE of your choice and NPM installed with
                http-server. Http-server
                provides an excellent means of serving content on your local machine without having to worry about GH
                Page's
                hourly build limits.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <h3>Clone/Fork The Repository</h3>
        <p>
            The very first thing you should do is clone or fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
        </p>

        <h3>Tutorial and Sample Application Project Structure</h3>
        <p>
            This project is structured such that the static tutorial pages are found in the root directory while the
            sample application resides at "/app". Accessing the root will bring you to this page. This is important to
            keep in mind once you begin configuring your launch and redirect uris, as you must ensure you base
            everything
            off of the "/app" path. E.g. http://some-host/app/launch.html instead of http://some-host/launch.html.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application "/app" folder includes six files:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                ./index.html - This is the primary application content page which will be your redirect location. This
                file includes the script tag needed to handle the SMART Oauth2 authorization and subsequent resource
                requests.
            </li>
            <li>
                ./launch-cerner.html - This is an R4 launch page intended for use with the Cerner R4 sandbox. It sets
                the scope to include "patient/MedicationRequest.read" to be compatible with R4 FHIR structures. (Scopes
                will be discussed in more detail momentarily.)
            </li>
            <li>
                ./launch-epic.html - This is the dstu2 launch page intended for use with Epic and dstu2 FHIR servers. In
                place of the MedicationRequest resource, it sets scope for MedicationOrder.
            </li>
            <li>
                ./launch.html - This is a convenience file include for use with any other sandboxes you wish to test,
                allowing you to maintain distinct launch contexts for multiple simultaneously. It includes commented
                out versions of the scopes for both dstu2 and R4.
            </li>
            <li>
                ./css/app.css - This is just your friendly neighborhood CSS styling so the sample application isn't too
                hideous to look at.
            </li>
            <li>
                ./js/fhir-demonstration.js - This is the core JavaScript used in the application. It consists of a
                series
                of basic functions that demonstrate how to use the client to request data from the FHIR server.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Publish your Application</h2>
        <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
        <p>
            GitHub Pages is the recommended means of standing up your application for use on SMART sandboxes.
            Here we will go through the steps needed to get up and running.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                If you haven't, fork this repository to your own GitHub account. You may do so using the
                "Fork" option in the top right corner of the GitHub browser interface. Alternatively, you
                may download or clone the repository locally and then push it to your own repo from there.
            </li>
            <li>
                In your repo, go to "Settings". You will be taken to the main "Options" section of the repository settings. If you are not here, select
                "Options" on the left.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scroll down until you see "GitHub Pages". Under "Source" select the branch you would like to
                use. If you wish to create a branch specific to your GH Pages deployment, you can push your live
                code to that branch and then select it here. Otherwise, just choose "master". Leave the folder option
                as "/ (root)". Click "Save" when ready.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your code will now be published at:<br>
                https://[your-user-name].github.io/BasicSmartDemo/<br>
                Keep in mind that this specific link will take you to this tutorial, <em>not</em> your
                application given the project structure. Your application can be found at:<br>
                https://[your-user-name].github.io/BasicSmartDemo/app/
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>And you're all done!</p>

        <h3>Publish Locally with http-server</h3>
        <p>
            http-server provides a simple way to publish a local HTTP server for testing purposes.
            For more information, you can view http-server on their NPM directory page
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The simplest means to install http-server is using NPM, with the line:<br>
            <code>npm install --global http-server</code><br>
            In the project directory, you can then start the server with just:<br>
            <code>http-server</code><br>
            You will be given a list of IPs which you can access the server from. Remember the project
            structure means the root will be this tutorial, so you would access the application via
            something such as "http://127.0.0.1:8080/app".
        </p>
